# Kumparan-Task
Kumparan gave a project task to determine the skill test that I mastered for the initial selection process.

## Features
There are some such features like,

- **Readable and Maintainable code**
- **Modularization**
- **Stunning Design**
- **Dark Mode**
- **Reusable Code and Base**

## Improvement
And I've been thinking to improve this project by doing some stuff like,
- **Use Local Database (Room)**
- **Add Loading State use Shimmer**
- **Add some Reusable Components like SnackBar, ProgressDialog**
- **Add some pages so it looks like a real Application**
- **Use View Binding instead of Kotlin Extensions**
- **Complete the styles**
